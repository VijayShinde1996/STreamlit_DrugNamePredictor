# NLP Model Deployment on Streamlit Cloud

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model and deploying it on Streamlit Cloud using Python and GitHub.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Data Loading & EDA**: Analyzing and preparing data for modeling.
- **Text Preprocessing & Word to Vector Conversion**: Cleaning text data and transforming it into a vectorized format.
- **Model Selection & Training**: Building and training the model for predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance.
- **Saving the Model & Vectorizer Files**: Storing trained models for future use.
- **Streamlit UI Creation**: Designing a user interface for interaction.
- **Deploying on Streamlit Community Cloud**: Making the app accessible online.
